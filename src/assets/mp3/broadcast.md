Hello guys, welcome to my channel. My name is Gavin, and I’m currently looking for a full-stack or backend developer in the U.S. or a remote position.

I graduated from Guangdong University of Finance.

I have 8 years of experience in frontend development and 5 years of backend development. My tech stack includes React, Vue, JavaScript, TypeScript Vite, Java, Spring Boot, and more.

In my previous role at HSBC Technology China, I primarily used React and Spring Boot to build web and mobile systems, including OA and SaaS platforms. Since these projects supported financial workflows, I followed strict requirements and delivered secure, high-quality code. I also collaborated with global teams across multiple countries—including the UK, Poland, and India—in English, so I’m comfortable working in English.

In my free time, I usually spend about two hours a day learning online. I enjoy exploring tech communities like GitHub and Stack Overflow to improve my skills. I also apply new technologies in projects—for example, I recently used Docker to deploy my portfolio website, and use AI tools, including codex, chatGPT and Github Copilot to accelerate progress.

I take my work seriously and care about code quality. I’m also easygoing and enjoy sharing knowledge with teammates to solve problems together.

That’s all—thank you for watching.
